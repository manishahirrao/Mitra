## ⚠️ What CANNOT Be Completed (External Dependencies)

### Backend Integration Required

- ❌ Production deployment - needs app store accounts

### These Will Be Mocked/Stubbed
- ✅ Payment UI (mock gateway)
- ✅ Notification UI (local only)
- ✅ API service layer (mock responses)
- ✅ Test structure (no actual tests)
